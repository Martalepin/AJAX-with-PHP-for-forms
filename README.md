# AJAX-with-PHP-for-forms

in this homework for my WebScripting class. I created a database called "demo" with a table called "persons" with three columns: first_name, last_name and email_address. 
Then I created an html file (martacode.html) for a form that will add a record on my database using a JavaScript function inside a script tag and using http to send the form.
In the table.php file I used a html table to output the records from my database executing the query "SELECT".
The file AJAX Tutorial Homework contains the screen shots from this homework.
